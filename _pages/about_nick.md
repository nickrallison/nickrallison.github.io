I am an undergraduate electrical engineering student and computer science student at the University of Calgary. I enjoy coding and using coding to solve real world problems. I always try to learn as much as I can in any given situation, as a life long learner.

I am passionate about using my creativity and coming up with clever solutions to challenging problems and learning new things.

My hobbies include rock climbing, bouldering and skiing. I also enjoy tinking with computers and software to see what they can do.
