I created and programmed a robot dog, that included creating the inverse kinematics models for the legs in C++ and using ROS to control the robot.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/canis/cover.png" title="robot dog" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
