This was a group project where we created and programmed a robot hand to translate human speach into spelled sign language.

    </div>

We used EasyEDA for designing the electronics, C++ and ROS to program it on both the laptop that ran it as well as the ESP32 microcontroller that controlled the electronics. 

This is our final product:

The project was a lot of fun and we learned a lot about electronics, programming, and working in a group.
